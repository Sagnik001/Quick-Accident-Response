# Quick-Accident-Response

## Bengalathan 2019

In the recent years, video surveillance has been employed for roads monitoring in order to detect abnormal events and improve the safety procedures in case of emergency. Certain event, such as car collisions are difficult to detect when only the visual information is considered. The proposed solution offers a new dimension to this task. We consider the car collision impact sound spectral pattern to identify the accident event from background acoustic scene. Once the target event occurs, inform accordingly to the server (PCR van) for further action.

#### The solution should be able to distinguish impact sounds when vehicles ram into each other on the road. The solution needs to be real time and the nearest PCR van should be alerted so that precious lives can be saved.
